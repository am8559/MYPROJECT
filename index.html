<title> Alternative Milk Sources </title>
<h1> Alternative Milk Sources <h1>
<h3> Cow’s milk has become a frankenfood. It no longer has the nutritional value or health benefits it once did. 

There are alternatives however. </h3>
</head>
<body>
<p> -There are 5,416 species of mammals, all of which produce milk.</p>
<p> -One can also derive a milk-like substance from plants. </p>
<p>-Many of these alternatives have superior health benefits over cow’s milk. </p>
  <p>In mid 1800’s, the average cow yielded
 just under
 2 quarts of milk
    per day. 
By 1960, 
the yield was 
just over 
  9 quarts per day! 
  Today, 
Cows yield up to 
50 quarts 
    of milk per day!</p>
  <p>The reason for this dramatic increase in milk production is because cows were bred purely to have an unnaturally high milk production.
    NOT FOR THE QUALITY !! </p>

 <p>This is
 unnatural,
 forced,
  and unhealthy for both cows and humans. </p>

<p> Alternative 
Milk Sources. </p>
<p> Calcium is also better absorbed from plant derived milk. 
-Grown cows don’t drink milk, they get their calcium from plants
-Societies that don’t drink cow’s milk suffer less osteoporosis (weak bones)</p>

<p> 1. Goat’s milk is less allergenic.
2. Goat’s milk is naturally homogenized.
3. Goat’s milk is easier to digest.
4. Goat’s milk rarely causes lactose intolerance.
5. Goat’s milk matches up to the human body better than cow’s milk. </p>
<p> -The benefits of sheep’s milk are very similar to goat’s milk.
-Buffalo milk hasn’t been as manipulated as cow’s milk, so it is not subject to the same antibiotics, GMOs, and growth hormones as cows. </p>

<p> In a survey (conducted by Justin Genco), the 9 participants were found to actually prefer alternative milks/milk products more than cows. This shows how trying new milk sources may be of great pleasure as well as the health and nutritional benefits provided. </p>
